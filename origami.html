    <p class="project-sub-title">Web Application</p>

    <img class="main-image" src="img/thumb1v2.jpg">

      <p class="paragraph">The main project that i've been working on this semester is a web app called 'Origami'. The goal has been to design and develop an active web application primarily for use with smartphones. This has thouroughly tested my abilities as a visual designer in various areas such as user interface, user experience and illustration.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">The purpose of this project has been to challenge my self in an area of design that most interests me (e.g. apps). Rather than producing static concepts I set part of my goal to create something active. The digital design industry is continuously evolving and gave me inspiration to move out of my comfort zone by attempting something new. Challenging my self will also assist me in acheiving my learning outcomes for the semester and provide me with some skills that could be useful when entering the design industry.</p>

<p class="sub-title">Initial Idea</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/initial-idea.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">The basic idea for this project came from my habbit of folding paper planes. The challenge that I set my self was to create an iOS or web app. The function of the app could teach users to create various models of planes using paper. When researching paper plane tutorials across the web there were various sites featuring origami. This inspired me to push the idea a little further and base it around other types of origami.</p>

<p class="sub-title">Research</p>

<p class="paragraph">YouTube was my primary resource for learning to create origami. There are also various origami websites across the web that generally include photo and video instructions. Some even provided illustrated instructions that can easily be found on google images.</p>

<p class="paragraph">On the app store there are some origami apps that feature illustrated instructions. The most successful app is called 'How To Make Origami'. The instructions in the app are quite clear and feature a wide variety of origami objects to create. However, some of the negatives about this app include: an excessive amount of adverts, limited amount of origami unless the pro version is purchased and instructions have to be downloaded with the app. The download side is one of the most dominant negatives as it takes a while for them to load. As my project is web based this meant that the designs could load instantly on different pages. The design of the app interface and instructions also looked very out-dated. For example, it features bold and bright buttons that take up a lot of space. The instruction animations are also very slow and appear to be in stop motion making them frustrating to follow. One of the ideas that this app gave me for my own project is to create frequent updates to provide the user with the biggest collection of origami available. However, the initial plan is to start out small and gradually increase the app with content.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Throughout the design process I used sites such as Dribble and Behance for design inspiration. Some of the user interface designs on both dribbble and behance gave my designs inspiration in areas such as colour, buttons, layout, fonts etc. One of the best sites I used as a guide for creating a successful user interface is featured on Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/tips/">UI Design Do's and Dont's</a>. The guide covers a variety of areas in UI such as formatting content, text size, spacing, alignment etc.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/dribble2.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">This is one of the user interface designs that I used for inspiration in my own designs. It features a simple and clear tile layout with very subtle colour variations. One particular aspect of the design that I used in my own is the two tone colour icons. For example, this design features only white icons with various colour tiles. My designs feature one colour for each of the icon backgrounds and various tones for the actual icons.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Half way throughout this project I created a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/MX9KNMT">survey</a> and find out what some users thought about the current version of my app. There were over 20 users that took part in the survey. The results were mostly positive and provided me with useful feedback for future improvements. For example, some users felt that a button could be added for going back to the previous step in the apps instructions. Other users said that the images were slow at loading and indicated that the file sizes were too high. The overall rating for the app by the survey users is 3 out 5 stars.</p>

<p class="sub-title">Development</p>

<p class="paragraph">The finalized idea to be developed is an origami web app with simple illustrated instructions. The goals behind the app are to challenge my skills as a designer and produce something that any user can use for free. The content of the app will include a small variety of origami instructions. Most of the origami objects featured in this app are ones that I have learnt to create my self through videos tutorials on youtube.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/sketch.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">The design and development of this project began with some simple sketches of origami from observation. These were designed to be used as icons for each origami that will be featured in the app. Once finished they were vectorized in illustrator.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The illustrated icons are designed to be simplified versions of how each object would appear in real life. This meant using a very small amount of colour and tones to make them look realistic.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Before sketching out the origami instructions I took photos of the process whilst creating each origami object my self. This meant that I could use the images to reference for sketching the instructions. Another idea that I had for this app is to use photos instead of illustrations as the instructions. However, I felt that this could be created as a small feature in the app that is optional for the user if they prefer images to artwork. This feature hasn't yet been added to the final outcome but may be in the future. My reason for this is that I wanted the apps content to be low in file size for fast loading and portability.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/sketch2.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">Once the photos of each origami object were finished I began sketching the instructions from observation. The instructions had to be simple and clear for the user to follow. To test my instructions I followed them my self creating various objects and there were many times I had to erase and add new steps. Some of the inspiration for the instructions came from other origami sites and images on the web. Lines were used in each steps design to represent the area of paper that the user has to fold or cut. Arrows were additionally used to represent a detailed or complex fold. This sketching process was repeated until I had completed three origami object instructions.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/visual1.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">The sketches were verctorized in Adobe Illustrator with the use of pen tool and shape tools. To create an accurate design rulers had to be used when necassary. The colour of the illustrations were initially blue as this is a calming colour to use as the basic theme for the app. Once vectorized, each illustration had to be exported as a .png and imported to photoshop. The illustrations were then resized individually and saved for web as a .gif file. Whilst saving each design for web I continuously minimalized the amount of colours used to create the lowest file size possible. This meant that the final images could load faster in the web app and were still high in pixel quality.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/sketch6.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">After skecthing out the first set of instructions the process was repeated for other origami objects such as a Boat and Shuriken. Each set of instructions provided me with unqiue challenges to create a clear design for the user experience. This gave me an idea of updating the app with various levels of difficult such as easy, moderate and hard.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/sketch7.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">Once three sets of origami instructions were complete the next step had to be designing a user interface. This consisted of sketching out three various home pages each with very different styles. The idea that was chosen is simple featuring circular icons. This concept meant that a wide variety of icons could be displayed on the initial home page without the user having to scroll down. In contrast, one of the other concepts only displays three icons at a time meaning that the user would have to scroll down a lot. One of the other concepts is good but didn't allow space for a background as each icon is directly next to each other. This meant that the icons were not seperated and could be potentially confusing for the user. However, this idea could still be used but requires bigger colour variations for each icon to seperate them.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/sketch8.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">Now that the initial homescreen had been designed I experimented to see if there were any features worth adding or improving. This started by creating 3 icons in a row instead of 2. A lot of modern app UI designs feature bars at the top so i decided to add one. This could be used as the title for the page and for adding other features such as mini-menu or settings.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/sketch9.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">The overall layout design of the apps interface didn't need to be complicated. The screens feature a title bar that could show the object they're creating, image space for the instruction artwork, word instructions/guides and a button for changing steps. The last screen needed to have a finish button that could take the user back to the homescreen once the origami instructions are completed. The homscreen features seperate icons that each link to different sets of instructions. Sketching out a wireframe ensured that the layout is reliable and valid.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/mockups2.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">Mockups of the interface designs were created in photoshop. This allowed me to experiment with creative ideas such as changing the button icons, re-arranging and adding content, and colour variations. The primary colour theme that is used throughout the design is a navy blue and light grey. Both of these colours contrast making them stand out. Having a simple colour theme keeps things simple and doesn't confuse the user. If a third colour were added it may cause the content to look too seperated.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/icons.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">Throughout the interface design process I downloaded several icons from <a href="www.flaticon.com">Flat Icon</a>. Whilst coding the web app I experimented with various icons for the next and previous buttons. Icons are a very modern and useful way for creating a smooth user experience in design. Additionally, I added some text to the icons that provides further clarity as not all users may be familar with icon features.</p>

<img class="big-images" src="img/coding.jpg">

<p class="paragraph">To create the active project it required me to learn basic html and css. Before starting this project I was familar with creating websites but not web apps. It turns out that creating a web app can be quite difficult for various reasons. Some of these included responsive design to ensure that the interface was suitable for a wide variety of devices. Positioning and aligning elements to perfection has proven to be difficult in some areas such as centering icons both horizontally and vertically in alignment with text. The setup of individual origami instructions meant that a lot of seperate pages had to be created. At one point I had attempted to use css animations as an alternative but struggled to make them work accurately. This is something that interests me in developing my coding skills for the future.</p>

<p class="sub-title">Outcome</p>

<a href="http://www.dmd-winchester.org.uk/00-DMD16-STUDENTS/JoshBowden/V2/index.html"><img class="big-images" src="img/outcome1.jpg"></a>

<p class="paragraph">The final project outcome is a fully active <a href="http://www.dmd-winchester.org.uk/00-DMD16-STUDENTS/JoshBowden/V2/index.html">web app</a> currently only for use with smartphones in portrait mode. One of the improvements for the future will be to make it compatible with desktops. There are three origami objects featured with full instructions. Overall I am happy with how this project has turned out and look forward to improving it with future updates.</p>

<p class="paragraph1">Reflecting on this project has made me realize some of the challenges that a designer can face when working individually. Time managaement is highly important for creating a successful application in a short period of time. My initial plans for this project were to create an iOS app. However, earlier on in the semester I struggled learning the skills needed to do this. My lecturer then suggested to focus on a web app version as this is something that would be a lot more realistic for the time period. Overall, this project has given me a deep insight in to app design in general. It has made me aware of the challenges in areas such as illustration, UI and UX, and creating an active project as opposed to static. For my self design and development work hand in hand, one cannot be complete without the other. This has also given me inspiration to improve my skillset as both a designer and developer. To concluce, the project has been for the most past successful in helping me to achieve my learning outcomes and better my self as a visual designer for the future...</p>
